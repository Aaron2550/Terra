# Terra
Terra is a data-driven world generator based on [Gaea](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Gaea). Find out more on our
[Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/85151/)!

## Building and running Terra
To run Terra on a test server, clone this repo, package with Maven, then run `test.sh`. The script will clone a test
server skeleton (found [here](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/WorldGenTestServer)) and set everything up to run.   
   
**Note: You will need to adjust the `NAME` variable in test.sh if you are not using the default Terra config (you may
also change the value after server installation, in `bukkit.yml` of the test server)**

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to see a feature in Terra, please, open an issue, or implement it yourself and
submit a PR!

## Beta
Terra is still in beta! While it is stable, it is not feature-complete. There is a lot to be added!
